// Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette versions.
// Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of publications.
// From this class derive two classes: book which adds a page count (type int) and tape which adds
// a playing time in minutes (type float).
// Write a program that instantiates the book and tape class, allows user to enter data and displays
// the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values
